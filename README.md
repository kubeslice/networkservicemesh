## What is Network Service Mesh

Network Service Mesh (NSM) is a novel approach solving complicated L2/L3 use cases in Kubernetes that are tricky to address with the existing Kubernetes Network Model. Inspired by Istio, Network Service Mesh maps the concept of a Service Mesh to L2/L3 payloads as part of an attempt to re-imagine NFV in a Cloud-native way!

For more information, have a look at our detailed overview of NSM - [What is NSM?](https://kubeslice.io/documentation/open-source/1.2.0/overview/components#network-service-mesh-control-and-data-plane).
